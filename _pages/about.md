I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Decisions, Operations and Technology (DOT) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Business School, specializing in Management Information Systems. Prior to that, I worked as a financial crime data consultant at PwC London. 

I obtained a Master of Science in [Statistical Science](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk) from [Univeristy of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk) in 2022. My dissertation is on Model Comparison in Levy Stochastic Volatility Markets, supervised by [Prof. Matthias Winkel](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/matthias-winkel). I obtained a Bachelor of Science in [Applied Mathematics](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu) with [Specialization in Computing](https://zuma.pic.ucla.edu/info/mission.shtml) and a Bachelor of Science in [Statistics](https://statistics.ucla.edu), both from [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu) in 2020. 

My research interest lies in Explainable AI (XAI) in Finance, Regtech and Fintech.
